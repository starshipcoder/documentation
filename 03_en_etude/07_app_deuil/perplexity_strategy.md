Rapport Complet - Novembre 11, 2025
📊 RÉSUMÉ EXÉCUTIF - VERDICT FINAL
🟢 RECOMMANDATION : GO - WITH CRITICAL CONDITIONS

Le marché des technologies de deuil et mémoriaux représente une opportunité significative de $25-30 milliards USD avec un CAGR moyen de 10%. Le segment Digital Legacy (le plus performant) passe de $22.46 milliards (2024) à $78.98 milliards (2034), avec un CAGR impressionnant de 13.4%.​

Positifs (Market Attractiveness : 8/10)
✅ TAM Suffisant : $25-30B addressable market with strong growth drivers (AI, employer demand, Gen Z adoption)​

✅ Marché Fragmenté : Aucun leader dominantpossédant >50% market share. Cake (leader apparent) = 30M+ users mais reste fragmenté. Opportunity for differentiation exists​

✅ Tendances Favorables : Digital memorials croissent 54% (2021→2023). Gen Z 4x plus likely to use grief apps vs Boomers​

Risques Critiques (⚠️ EXISTENTIAL)
⚠️ CHURN UTILISATEUR = RISQUE EXISTENTIEL : Mental health app 30-day retention = 3.9% median, vs industry average 5.5-19.1%. Objectif critique : >30% for viability. "When therapy works, people leave" = business model paradox​

⚠️ Compliance Coûteux : GDPR ($200K-500K initial) + HIPAA ($300K-1M if grief counseling). Total = $300K-1M+ investment requis​

⚠️ Post-Mortem Data Rights = GREY ZONE : Deceased have NO privacy rights under GDPR/HIPAA (legal ambiguity). GDPR amendments expected 2025-2026. Compliance strategy = undefined risk​

⚠️ Regulatory Uncertainty : 72 new funeral apps launched 2024. Category saturation increasing. ASO competition fierce​
